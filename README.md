# Sudoku-Game-Python-

## Overview

I decided to explore making Sudoku using Python 3. This game is fun, challenging, and a classic. Programming Sudoku uses a range of programming topics so I thought
it would be a great project to add to my portfolio. Some of the computer science topics covered in this game are funtions, loops, reading and editing JSON files, arrays, tuples,
input validation, error handling, and if elif else statements. 

## Development Environment
* Python 3
* JSON

## Useful Websites
* [Programming with functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
* [Loops](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-python/)
* [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp)
* [Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-arrays/)
* [Error Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
* [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)
* [Control flow tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)

## Future Work

* Right now the game only plays one board. I plan on finding a variety of different boards to play. 
* There is no auto solver. I plan on implementing an auto solve feature using recursion to solve the game.
